# Recilia  
### AI-Powered Smart Recipe Generator using Groq and LLaMA  

## Project Overview  

Recilia is an AI-based smart recipe generation system that creates structured and personalized recipes from user-provided ingredients. 
The system uses Groq API to access LLaMA models for generating context-aware and optimized cooking instructions.
It helps users discover recipes based on available ingredients along with filtering options such as cuisine type, dietary preference, cooking time, and calorie requirements.  
The main objective of Recilia is to simplify cooking decisions by transforming raw ingredients into meaningful and practical recipes using generative AI.

## Key Features  

- AI-powered recipe generation using LLaMA via Groq API  
- Ingredient-based recipe creation system  
- Cuisine-based filtering (North, South, East, West Indian and more)  
- Cooking time optimization for quick and detailed recipes  
- Calorie-aware recipe suggestions  
- Dietary preference support (Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian)  
- Meal type classification (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)  
- Structured recipe output including ingredients, steps, cooking time, and nutrition  
- API-based multilingual recipe translation support

## System Architecture  

User Input (Ingredients and Filters)  
→ Frontend Interface  
→ Backend Server  
→ Groq API (LLaMA Model Processing)  
→ AI Generated Recipe Response  
→ Frontend Display  

The backend acts as a bridge between the user interface and the AI model API, handling request formatting and response processing.
